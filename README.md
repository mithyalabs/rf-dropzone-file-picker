# rf-dropzone-file-picker
A package that runs on top of [react-forms](https://github.com/mithyalabs/ml-react-forms) and provides a drag and drop file input.
## Dependencies:
1. react-dropzone
2. react-forms
3. clsx
4. lodash
5. formik
## How to use:
In your config, add the following to get the basic dropzone file input:
```
{
	type: 'drop-file',
	valueKey: 'myValueKey',
	fieldProps: {}
}

```
fieldProps has the following type:
```
{
	onDropFile?: (files: File[]) => void
	/* onDropFile is triggered soon after a file is dropped in the dropzone and has been added to the form */
	multiple?: boolean
	label?: string | JSX.Element
	accept?: string, 
	readAs?: ReadAsType
	activeClass?: string
	defaultClass?: string
	fullWidth?: boolean
}
```
You can customise the look of the dropzone using activeClass and defaultClass props. Active class contains rules that will take effect on dragging a file over the area.Eg.: backgroundColor, textColor, etc., while defaultClass is for class with rules that will not be affected by dragging a file over the area. Eg.: height, width, border, borderRadius, etc.
If there are common rules in both classes, CSS specificity will take over and the class defined later will take effect.
fullWidth sets the width to 100% (only when no defaultClass is provided). Default is 400px.
